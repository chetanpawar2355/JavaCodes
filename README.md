# Java Programs
## Day 1 : Primitive Data Types
- There are 8 Types of Primitive data types in Java:
  - byte
  - int
  - short
  - long
  - float
  - double
  - char
  - boolean

## Day 2 : Operators
- Arithmetic Operator:
  - +, -, *, /, %
- Relational/Comparison Operator:
  - <, >, <=, >=, ==
- Assignment Operator:
  - =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=
- Logical Operators:
  - AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!)
- Increment/Decrement Operator:
  - ++, --

## Day 3 : String
### What is String?
A String is a sequence of characters. Strings are immutable.
### String Methods
- name.length()
- name.toLowerCase()
- name.toUpperCase()
- name.trim()
- name.substring(start, end)
- name.replace(old, new)
- name.startsWith(string)
- name.endsWith(string)
- name.charAt(int index)
- name.indexOf(string, int index)
- name.equals(string)
- name.equalsIgnoreCase(string)

## Day 4 : Conditional Statement
### if else Statement
This is a bi-directional conditional control statement. This checks the condition whether it is true(if) or it is false(else).
### switch Statement
Switch Statement is used to when we have to make a choice between number of alternatives for a given variable.
It is an alternative of if-else Statement.

## Day 5 : Looping Statement
### while loop
Repeats a block of code as long as a given condition is true.
### do while loop
Executes a block of code once, then repeats it as long as the condition is true.
### for loop
Repeats a block of code a specific number of times, using an initializer, condition, and increment/decrement.

## Day 6 : Arrays
Array is a collection of Similar types of data.
Index = 0 to n-1

## Day 7 : Methods
In Java, a method is a block of code that performs a specific task.

## Day 8 : Method Overloading
Method Overloading allows us to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class.

## Day 9 : Recursion
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition to solve a problem.

## Day 10 : OOPs in Java
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

### Classes and Objects
- Class : A Class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
- Object : An object is an instance of a class.

The core Principles, often called the "four pillars" of OOPs in Java, are:
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

## Day 11 : Getter And Setter
The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.
- declare class variables/attributes as private
- provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable

## Day 12 :
